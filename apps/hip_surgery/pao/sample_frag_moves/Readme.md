# Random Simulation of Periacetabular Osteotomy Fragment Adjustments
This tool samples random adjustments (rigid movements) of periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) bone fragments and the ipsilateral femur.
Plausible movements are enforced by sampling rigid transformations with anatomical priors and by checking for collision with bone structures.

A comprehensive listing of the program's usage may be obtained by passing `-h` or `--help`.

An example of this program's usage is given in the walkthrough [here](https://github.com/rg2/jhmr-v2/wiki/Walkthrough%3A-Simulated-PAO-Adjustments).
