# Volumetric Modeling of Periacetabular Osteotomies
This tool allows periacetabular osteotomies to be modeled volumetrically, both shape and rigid movement, which enables simulation studies incorporating Hounsfield units and soft tissue.

A comprehensive listing of the program's usage may be obtained by passing `-h` or `--help`.

An example of this program's usage is provided in the walkthrough [here](https://github.com/rg2/jhmr-v2/wiki/Walkthrough%3A-Volumetric-Modeling-of-PAO-Adjustments).
